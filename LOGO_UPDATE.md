# 🎨 Logo Update Instructions

## 📍 **Where to Place Your Logo**

Save your new ReelHub logo image to:
```
assets/images/logo.png
```

This will automatically replace the old logo in:
- ✅ Home screen (`app/index.jsx`)
- ✅ Sign in page (`app/(auth)/sign-in.jsx`)
- ✅ Sign up page (`app/(auth)/sign-up.jsx`)
- ✅ Anywhere `images.logo` is used

## 📐 **Recommended Logo Sizes**

For best quality, provide:
- **Main logo**: 1024x1024px or larger (PNG with transparent background)
- **Small logo**: 512x512px for `logo-small.png`

## 🔄 **Current Logo Usage**

The logo is used in:
1. **Home/Welcome Screen** - Large logo at top
2. **Sign In Page** - Medium logo
3. **Sign Up Page** - Medium logo

All use: `images.logo` from `constants/images.js`

## ✅ **After Saving**

1. Save your logo as `assets/images/logo.png`
2. Restart Expo: `npm start`
3. The new logo will appear automatically!

**Note**: The logo path is already configured in `constants/images.js`, so just replace the file!
